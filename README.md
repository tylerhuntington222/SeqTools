### Analysis Questions

1. What general observations do you make about the differences/similarities between our 3 ways of estimating
the hidden state sequence (Viterbi, decoding, mean)? Which would you choose if you could only pick one?

3. For the two true Tmrca sequences (`true_tmrca_test.txt` and `true_tmrca.txt`), how did the estimated
state sequences change between using the "initial" parameters and using the "estimated" parameters?
Why might we observe this difference? How did the log-likelihoods change for these two datasets?

4. For the `true_tmrca.txt` dataset, what was the difference in your output plots between mu, 2mu, and 5mu?
Why might we observe this difference as the mutation rate increases?
